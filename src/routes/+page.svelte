            <p>üîó RoTUer is a project made by (soon-to-be) students of TU Delft. The main goal is to help other students find websites that contain information that they are searching and to generalize all possible things you can make use of in the Uni.</p>

                <h3>About RoTUer</h3>
                <p>RoTUer was made to help people like me who just suddenly find themselves in a place with endless possibilities - you can book books, rooms for teams, printing machines etc. Even now I start forgetting all the other stuff. This is why we wanted to present all this information in a summarized form with links.</p>
