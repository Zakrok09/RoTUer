Since there is a lot of information, the ones that will be presented first are Common, CSE and ASE.</p>\n<p>Things that will come later (maybe at 1.2.0) are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recipes (you are going to love this one)</li>\n<li>Better Campus Map</li>\n<li><em>…an app!?</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howwewillworkonceschoolstarts\">How we will work once school starts?</h2>\n<p>The thing is that most of us don't know how much will we have on our schedule. Our free time will get significantly shortened, therefore future updates will take longer to implement. </p>\n<p>This isn't the case with the Guidelines, Articles &amp; Links however! Those will be updated often since our Link gathering team is finding new links every day!</p>\n<h2 id=\"therotuertoolsapp\">The RoTUer Tools app</h2>\n<p>This is an app built in Tauri and SvelteKit.
